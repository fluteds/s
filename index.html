    <p>You shouldn't be here.
      <br>An error has occured:
      <p>* The URL you provided is invalid.<br />
        * GitHub limited your ip address to access the api.<br />
        * If the error persists, please open an issue.</p>
      <p>This is a URL shortnener hosted by issues opened on GitHub.</p>

      <h1 class="neg title"><span class="bg">URL Shortener</span></h1>
      <p><strong>Hosted by Github Pages</strong></p>
      <p>This is a minimal URL shortener that can be entirely hosted on GitHub pages. It does not need the maintenance
        of any servers or databases and can be hosted
        entirely on GitHub for free! This repo is forked from <a
          href="https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener">nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener</a> and
        maintained.</p>
      <p><strong>Link to Repo:</strong> <a href="https://dont-ghost.me/1">dont-ghost.me/1</a></p>
      <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
      <p>To add a new link: </p>

      * Open an issue <strong>with the title being the link you want to shorten</strong> including the
      <code>http(s)://</code> to <a href="https://github.com/fluteds/sdb/issues">/sdb/issues</a>.<br>
      * The newly created short url can be accessed via the users default GitHub pages domain or a custom domain (if
      enabled.)<br>
      * The short url will be automatically generated and the issue will be closed.<br>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
      <p>Unlike many URL shorteners, this one uses a &quot;database&quot; in the form of GitHub issues and can be
        entirely hosted via GitHub pages. </p>
